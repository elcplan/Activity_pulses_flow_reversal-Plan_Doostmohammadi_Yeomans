# Activity_pulses_flow_reversal-Plan_Doostmohammadi_Yeomans
This code accompanies the paper submitted to the J. Royal Soc. Interface entitled "Activity pulses induce spontaneous flow reversals in viscoelastic environments" as submitted Feb 2021.

This code may not be shared or used without permission from the authors.

This zip file contains the full hybrid Lattice Boltzman hydrodynamic simulations as applied for the context of the project and the simiplied equations that can be used in Matlab.

For the full simulations, we use gcc. See makefile for more details. To run for activity pulses, one needs to (1) restart the code after each run, of course adjusting the initial and terminal conditions, or (2) prepare a script that will do this automatically.).
